title = {Multiple-systems analysis for the quantification of modern slavery: classical and Bayesian approaches},
abstract = {Multiple systems estimation is a key approach for quantifying hidden populations such as the number of victims of modern slavery. The UK Government published an estimate of 10,000 to 13,000 victims, constructed by the present author, as part of the strategy leading to the Modern Slavery Act 2015. This estimate was obtained by a stepwise multiple systems method based on six lists. Further investigation shows that a small proportion of the possible models give rather different answers, and that other model fitting approaches may choose one of these. Three data sets collected in the field of modern slavery, together with a data set about the death toll in the Kosovo conflict, are used to investigate the stability and robustness of various multiple systems estimate methods. The crucial aspect is the way that interactions between lists are modelled, because these can substantially affect the results. Model selection and Bayesian approaches are considered in detail, in particular to assess their stability and robustness when applied to real modern slavery data. A new Markov Chain Monte Carlo Bayesian approach is developed; overall, this gives robust and stable results at least for the examples considered. The software and datasets are freely and publicly available to facilitate wider implementation and further research.},

 abstract = {Modeling of multivariate unordered categorical (nominal) data is a challenging problem, particularly in high dimensions and cases in which one wishes to avoid strong assumptions about the dependence structure. Commonly used approaches rely on the incorporation of latent Gaussian random variables or parametric latent class models. The goal of this article is to develop a nonparametric Bayes approach, which defines a prior with full support on the space of distributions for multiple unordered categorical variables. This support condition ensures that we are not restricting the dependence structure a priori. We show this can be accomplished through a Dirichlet process mixture of product multinomial distributions, which is also a convenient form for posterior computation. Methods for nonparametric testing of violations of independence are proposed, and the methods are applied to model positional dependence within transcription factor binding motifs.},

abstract = {We determine the number of labelled chordal planar graphs with n vertices, which is asymptotically g⋅n−5/2γnn! for a constant g>0 and γ≈11.89235. We also determine the number of rooted simple chordal planar maps with n edges, which is asymptotically s⋅n−3/2δn, where s>0, δ=1/σ≈6.40375, and σ is an algebraic number of degree 12. The proofs are based on combinatorial decompositions and singularity analysis. Chordal planar graphs (or maps) are a natural example of a subcritical class of graphs in which the class of 3-connected graphs is relatively rich. The 3-connected members are precisely chordal triangulations, those obtained starting from K4 by repeatedly adding vertices adjacent to an existing triangular face.}

The edit operations investigated allow changing one symbol of a string into another single symbol, deleting one symbol from a string, or inserting a single symbol into a string. An algorithm is presented which solves this problem in time proportional to the product of the lengths of the two strings. Possible applications are to the problems of automatic spelling correction and determining the longest subsequence of characters common to two strings.},
